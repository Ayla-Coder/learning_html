   <!-- paragraphs -->
    <p>This is a single paragraph</p>
    <p>This is a second paragraph</p>

    <!-- lists: Each item inside the lists is put inside an <li> (list item) element. -->
    <h3>Unordered lists: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Patches is fuzzy</li>
      <li>Patches is fat</li>
      <li>I am procrastinating</li>
      <li>How about that</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ordered lists: </h3>
    <ol> 
      <li>Thomas is farty</li>
       <li>Thomas is cute</li>
      <li>He likes mechanical doodads</li>
      <li>And he sure loves to toot</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>inserting links requires an anchor a, which is the text that will display for the link. </p>
    <p>links also need an href element inside the first anchor a, whatever that means. This is where the actual link is pasted.</p>

    <a href = "https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/"> 
      Mozilla Manifesto
    </a>

    <p>The tutorial now says that href stands for: hypertext reference</p>

    <h2>styling the content</h2>
    <p>I will now move on to css files which dictate how a website is styled.</p>
    <p>In order to do this, I made a new file called style.css and put it in a new folder called styles. Now I have to paste this line of text between the head arguments between carrots at the top of this html file: </p>
    <p> link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet" /</p>
  </body>
</html>
